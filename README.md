<b>S3Exploits</b> is a script that automates to find out the AWS misconfigured S3 buckets that can lead pentester to exposed many vulnerabilities (XSS, phishing, site deface, many more).

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aju100/s3-exploit
cd s3-exploit
chmod +x main.sh
./main.sh
```

>Note: Make sure you have install aws cli
```bash
sudo apt-get install awscli
```


You are required to insert the list of s3 buckets in s3_buckets to test whether it's vulnerable or not. If you are pentesting for other companies or organizations, make sure you use the below tools to identify s3 buckets.

- [lazyrecon](https://github.com/nahamsec/lazyrecon)
- [s3recon](https://github.com/clarketm/s3recon)
- [bucky](https://github.com/smaranchand/bucky)


If you have discovered subdomains, then you can also check out whether it has s3 buckets.

> Make sure you have install [httpx](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx)
```bash
cat sub-domains.txt | httpx -status-code --path .s3.amazonaws.com
```

If you are testing your own s3 buckets then use the below commands to list s3 buckets and create an s3_buckets.txt

> First, you need to configure aws credentials.
```bash
aws configure
aws s3 ls >> buckets.txt
sed -E 's/([0-9]{1,4}-){1,2}[0-9]{2} ([0-9]{2}:){1,2}[0-9]{2}//g' buckets.txt >> s3_buckets.txt
```
